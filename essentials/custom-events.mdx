HumanBehavior SDK lets you track any user action or business event with custom events.

## What is a Custom Event?

A custom event is any user action you want to track beyond the automatic events (like button clicks, link clicks, and form submissions).

## Example: Tracking a Custom Event

```javascript
import { HumanBehaviorTracker } from 'humanbehavior-js';
const tracker = HumanBehaviorTracker.init('your-api-key');
await tracker.customEvent('purchase_completed', {
  orderId: 'order-123',
  total: 99.99
});
```

## Automatic Tracking

The SDK automatically tracks button clicks, link clicks, and form submissions. You only need to use custom events for additional business logic or analytics.

## Advanced Usage

- You can use any event name and any properties (string, number, boolean, array, object)
- Use custom events for e-commerce, feature usage, error tracking, or any business-specific analytics
- For best results, use consistent event names and property keys
- All custom events are associated with the current session and user
