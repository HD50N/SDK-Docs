# HumanBehavior SDK

HumanBehavior SDK is a powerful JavaScript library for tracking user sessions, recording user interactions, and analyzing user behavior in web applications. Built on top of [rrweb](https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb), it provides high-fidelity session recordings with advanced features like data redaction, user identification, and custom event tracking.
